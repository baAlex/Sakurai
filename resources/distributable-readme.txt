Troubleshooting
---------------
### A. The game quits abruptly / I found an error / A bug

An apology for such unstable game, as an alpha release the idea is
to use as many eyes as possible to find bugs and fix them quickly.
Please report it at:

- The game website: https://baalex.itch.io/tanakas-magical-business
- Github: https://github.com/baAlex/Sakurai/issues
- Or in the contacts above if you prefer


### B. When the game ends?

There is no end, still, the game starts repeating after the 32nd
encounter. Congratulations if you went that far!.


### C. I found an English typo!

Contact me. Most people don't report typos and for a non-native
speaker you can't imagine how valuable is.
