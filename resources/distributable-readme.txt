Troubleshooting
---------------
### A. I can't run the game on Windows

Modern versions of Windows are not supported. If is the case you
should use an emulator.

Older versions as 3.0, 95, 98 or ME are know to work well having the
caution of meet the minimum requirements.


### B. When the game ends?

There is no end, still, the game start repeating after the 32nd
encounter. Congratulations if you went that far!.


### C. I found an English typo!

Contact me. Most people don't report typos and for a non-native
speaker you can't imagine how valuable is.
